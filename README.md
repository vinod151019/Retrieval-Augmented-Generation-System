# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-System
Crafted a retrieval-augmented question-answering (RAG) system, using Langchain with a 4-bit quantized Llama2-7-b
model to generate responses outside of training data.
• Integrated ChromaDB for storing embeddings and efficient retrieval of similar data points from the corpus using vector
similarity retrieval function.
• Accomplished 65% reduction in hallucinations and bias. Improved contextual understanding by 15%.
